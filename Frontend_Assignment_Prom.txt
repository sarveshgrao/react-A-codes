Please help me out with React frontend assignment. Please also provide folder structure and codes of each file in your project structure as well.                                                                               
## Problem Statement
![Trello](https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/meta/p/res/images/spirit/product/89d378b845766a8f0c48e955336266f8/board.png)

- Implement a simple page that has 3 column lists (a simple bootstrap design is preferred).
- You can use the above image as a reference.
- Each column will contain multiple cards.
- The order of the cards should be maintained.
- The card should show a title and a description.
- The state should be maintained after refresh.
- There should be a button at the top to add a new card.
- User should be able to move a card from one column to another by drag and drop.

### Add Card
- On clicking the add card button, a modal popup should be shown with a form.
- The form should contain title, description and column selection dropdown.
- Title should be validated and should only contain alphabets.
- Description should be validated and should be a minimum of 25 characters.
- On submission, the card should be added to the end of the selected column.

### Edit Card
- On clicking a card, the add card modal popup should be shown with the add card form with the prefilled data.
- If the user changes the column then, the card should be added to the end of the selected column.
- There should be a button to delete the card in the popup.

# Instructions
- Use simple bootstrap components (additional libraries and css can be used but does not have any weightage in the review).
- React should be used and the codebase should be AOT compilable.                                           - Please make use of UseImmer and Usereducer  React hooks along with redux for state management
- Host the resulting webpage as a simple website in a github.io page or any other free static host.
- The codebase should be hosted in a public git repo.

# Deliverables
- Link to the static hosted page.
- Link to the public git repo of the codebase.
- Documentation file detailing the design approach and choices used in the code design should also to be added in the git repo
